# Dynamic Array Manipulation

## Overview

This C++ program demonstrates the manipulation of a dynamic array. It includes functions to print the array and to create a new array containing only non-negative elements from the original array. The program uses dynamic memory allocation and pointer arithmetic to achieve this.

## Example Output

**Original Array**:`12 -3 45 -7 89 23 -34 56 78 -9`

**Non-negative Array**: `12 45 89 23 56 78`
